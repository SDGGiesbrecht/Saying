     English: It is generally advised to use the safer variant {remove first from ()} instead. For valid parameters, its effects are exactly the same.

    [
     English: Skipping the bounds check can be more efficient when a first element is already known from context to exist. However, the caller takes responsibility for assuring that the slice is not empty. Removing from an empty slice may cause a fatal error or overflow into invalid program state.
